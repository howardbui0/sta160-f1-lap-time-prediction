# STA 160 Final Project - F1 Lap Time Prediction

This project simulates and predicts Formula 1 lap times using historical race data and a Random Forest regression model.

## Files
- `final-report.pdf`: Full project report.
- `code/sta160-lap-time-prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code for data processing, model development, and simulation.

## Dataset
The dataset is from the [Kaggle Formula 1 Lap Time Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/formula-1-lap-time-prediction-nwvs-s00e02) and is not included due to competition guidelines.

## Project Summary
- Built Random Forest model for lap time prediction.
- Simulated a 52-lap race for Charles Leclerc at Silverstone (2025 British Grand Prix).
- Demonstrated realistic lap time predictions aligned with historical performance.
